## Recent Updates (January 2025)

### Streamlined Recipe Management

We've implemented a new streamlined workflow for recipe creation and editing that significantly improves the user experience:

- **Instant Save**: Recipes are saved immediately upon creation
- **Incremental Steps**: Add recipe steps one by one after creation
- **Auto-Save**: Changes are automatically saved with a 3-second debounce
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators show when data is being saved

### Technical Improvements

- Enhanced form state management
- Improved error handling and validation
- Better UX with immediate persistence
- Optimized network requests with debouncing
