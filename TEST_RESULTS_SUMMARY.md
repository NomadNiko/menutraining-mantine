# Test Results Summary

## Overview
- Total tests: 161
- Test environment: Playwright with Chromium
- Status: Many tests are timing out due to slow page loads

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Performance Issues
- Pages taking 4-6 seconds to compile on first load
- Sign-in page consistently slow (5-6 seconds)
- This causes many tests to timeout waiting for elements

### 2. Test Categories

#### Authentication Tests
- Basic authentication: ✓ PASSING
- Edge cases: MIXED (some timeouts on forgot password, session handling)
- Password visibility toggle: ✓ PASSING
- OAuth flows: ✓ PASSING

#### Admin Panel Tests
- Most tests timing out waiting for sign-in
- Need to increase timeouts or optimize page load times

#### Restaurant Management Tests
- Status: UNKNOWN (blocked by auth timeouts)

#### Quiz Tests
- Status: UNKNOWN (blocked by auth timeouts)

#### Demo Tests
- Status: UNKNOWN (blocked by auth timeouts)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Increase test timeouts in playwright.config.ts
   - Consider using production build for tests instead of dev server
   - Add explicit waits for page hydration

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Investigate why pages take 4-6 seconds to compile
   - Consider pre-building pages before tests
   - Optimize bundle sizes

3. **Test Improvements**
   - Add retry logic for flaky tests
   - Use page.waitForLoadState('networkidle') after navigation
   - Add custom wait conditions for React hydration

## Next Steps

1. Fix the authentication flow timeouts first
2. Then systematically fix each test suite
3. Add performance benchmarks to prevent regression
