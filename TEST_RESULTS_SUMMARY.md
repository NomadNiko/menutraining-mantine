# Test Results Summary

## Overview

- Total tests: 161
- Test environment: Playwright with Chromium
- Status: Many tests are timing out due to slow page loads

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Performance Issues

- Pages taking 4-6 seconds to compile on first load
- Sign-in page consistently slow (5-6 seconds)
- This causes many tests to timeout waiting for elements

### 2. Test Categories

#### Authentication Tests

- Basic authentication: ✓ PASSING
- Edge cases: MIXED (some timeouts on forgot password, session handling)
- Password visibility toggle: ✓ PASSING
- OAuth flows: ✓ PASSING

#### Admin Panel Tests

- Most tests timing out waiting for sign-in
- Need to increase timeouts or optimize page load times

#### Restaurant Management Tests

- Status: UNKNOWN (blocked by auth timeouts)

#### Quiz Tests

- Status: UNKNOWN (blocked by auth timeouts)

#### Demo Tests

- Status: UNKNOWN (blocked by auth timeouts)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**

   - Increase test timeouts in playwright.config.ts
   - Consider using production build for tests instead of dev server
   - Add explicit waits for page hydration

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Investigate why pages take 4-6 seconds to compile
   - Consider pre-building pages before tests
   - Optimize bundle sizes

3. **Test Improvements**
   - Add retry logic for flaky tests
   - Use page.waitForLoadState('networkidle') after navigation
   - Add custom wait conditions for React hydration

## Next Steps

1. Fix the authentication flow timeouts first
2. Then systematically fix each test suite
3. Add performance benchmarks to prevent regression

## Recent Development Updates (January 2025)

### New Features Requiring Tests

1. **Streamlined Recipe Workflow**

   - New route: `/restaurant/recipes/create-streamlined`
   - Edit route: `/restaurant/recipes/[id]/edit-streamlined`
   - Instant save on creation
   - Auto-save functionality
   - Visual feedback indicators

2. **Test Coverage Needed**

   - Recipe creation with instant save
   - Step addition after creation
   - Auto-save trigger and debounce
   - Save state indicator visibility
   - Form validation on streamlined workflow
   - Navigation between create and edit modes

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Auto-save may add network overhead
   - Need to test debounce timing
   - Verify save state indicators don't cause flicker
